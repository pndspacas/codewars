  <p>This is a repository filled with all the codewars challenges (kata) that I successfully solved.</p>

  <h2>How It's Made</h2>
  
  <p><b>Tech I used:</b> <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/30934920b46fd5b6874bf6ce5f9a3afd8ea0e5e4ed20ab9eda0450286ba7a138/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f7374617469632f76313f6c6162656c3d7c266d6573736167653d4a41564153435249505426636f6c6f723d336337663564267374796c653d706c6173746963266c6f676f3d6a617661736372697074"></p>
  <p>Everyday, the first thing I do is solve a Codewar!</p>

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

<p>I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p> There is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve, understand and get better each day.</p>
